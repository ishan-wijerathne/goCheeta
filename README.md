About GoCheeta
==============

“GoCheeta” is a well reputed cab service located in Sri Lanka Island wide. It has several branches
like Galle, Kandy, Nugegoda, Gampaha, Kurunegala and Jaffna). It has been delivering its
services in the mode of a mobile app, and now they want to implement it as in a website either due
to the requirement identified at several points.
The customers can get registered first to the system. Then a registered customer can order any type
of vehicle available via the website. But once the booking is made, both the pick-up and
destination locations will be restricted only within one exact city, that they choose out of the
given list(predefined as per only where branches are located in).
There are registered drivers in the system where the customer cannot pick one but depending on
the availability of vehicles, the driver associated will be selected and be informed by the system
